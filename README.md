Zipper 
======

This is an implementation of GÃ©rard Huet's [Zipper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipper_%28data_structure%29) in Scala. My starting point is [Huet's original paper](http://www.st.cs.uni-sb.de/edu/seminare/2005/advanced-fp/docs/huet-zipper.pdf) first describing this purely functional data structure in O'Caml. 

My goal here is to pratice Scala, not to provide any optimal implementation of the Zipper.
